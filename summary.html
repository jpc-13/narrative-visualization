        <h1>Wealth and Health Across the World</h1>
        <h3>An interactive slideshow exploring how wealth relates to well-being</h3>
    </div>
    <div style="height: 150px; padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <p>Each scene explored how GDP per capita relates to health indicators across the world. GDP per capita is a key measure of economic wealth over the entire population of a country.</p>
        <p>There is strong correlation between higher GDP and longer life expectancy, while the relationship with physicians per 1,000 was weaker and had more outliers. However, countries with very low physician availability often had lower GDPs. Countries with higher GDP per capita had lower infant mortaility rates.</p>
        <p>Overall, countries with more economic resources tend to support longer lives, and we could see this especially with life expectancy and infant mortality rate.</p>
